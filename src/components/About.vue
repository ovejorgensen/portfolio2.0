            Hi, my name is Ove JÃ¸rgensen. I am currently enrolled in a Master's
            degree at the University of Stavanger where I'm studying Data
            Science. I am also working part time as a software engineer at a
            small company.
            <br />
            <br />
            I created this website as a way to show of some of my work, but also
            as a playground and a way for me to further improve my
            web-programming skills. The front-end has been created using Vue and
            Vuetify, and it is hosted on AWS using AWS Amplify.
